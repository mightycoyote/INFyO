The response system of most contemporary string trick yoyos consists of a 19mm diameter ring of silicone or silicone rubber. Silicone response lasts a fairly long time under normal use, but not forever. Some of the cheaper responsive bearing plastic yoyos use starburst response instead.</p>\n              <Img src={bearing} alt=\"Inside of a ball bearing yoyo\" caption=\"The guts of a ball bearing yoyo with silicone response.\" />\n            </div> \n          </div>\n          <h5>String trick yoyo bearings</h5>\n          <div className=\"column-nowrap\">\n            <div className=\"primary\">\n              <p>The majority of string trick yoyos all take the same standard diameter bearing. <em>The narrow \"half-spec\" version is used for responsive play, and its wider sibling the \"C\" bearing for unresponsive play</em>.</p>\n              <ul>\n                <li><b>Half-spec bearings</b> generally need a thick lube or silicone grease in them to respond properly. When a half-spec bearing comes installed in your new beginner-friendly yoyo, it may have been lubed already, but eventually it will stop returning easily with a tug and you'll have to add more. Fortunately, household 3-in-1 oil works fine for this.</li> \n                <li><b>\"C\" bearings</b> <a href=\"#lube\">can be played without lube</a>. But, they have more variations. Most yoyos come with one that's concave, or has a groove or channel in it, instead of a plain flat bearing. This helps keep the string towards the center of the bearing, which in turn makes it easier to keep the yoyo from drifting off plane. Centering bearings are popular for good reason, but bearing shape is also a matter of personal preference, and not all yoyos work equally well with all shapes.</li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n            <aside className=\"box\">\n              <span className=\"boxhead\">Big and small</span>\n              <p>Manufacturers do still make some string trick yoyos that take bearings other than \"C\"&mdash;typically \"D\" or \"A\". That would be mentioned in the product description, though. If the size isn't mentioned and it's a contemporary string trick yoyo, you can assume it's size C.

Some higher-end aluminum yoyos are made out of these. Harder and denser than 6061, it can be machined a little thinner, and can result in higher-performing, slightly more damage-resistant yoyos.

The advantage of titanium is similar to 7000-series aluminum, only even more so&mdash;it can be machined even thinner, and is very durable. However, it does not perform objectively better than aluminum. (If that were the case, titanium would routinely be used by serious competitors, but it isn't.) They're much more expensive than most nice competition bimetals, and often very limited, and you're not really missing out if you don't have one.</p>\n                  <p className=\"point\">... That said, if you want titanium anyway, one good way to go about it is to keep an eye out for preorder announcements. They're sometimes available used too, of course, but not necessarily at a bargain price.</p>\n                </div>\n                <Img src={tivayder} alt=\"Titanium yoyo\" caption=\"A titanium yoyo (Ti-Vayder #206).\" />\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n              <h4>Steel</h4>\n              <p>Steel is <em>extremely</em> heavy, but sometimes small yoyos are made out of it.

They don't last long and need to be checked for wear regularly. Synthetic strings don't usually wear out enough to break&mdash;<a href=\"#changingstrings\">generally they become unusable in other ways before then</a>. Breakage is more likely with cotton, however.</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <h4>Polyester</h4> \n                <p>The standard for most kinds of play. They range from very cheap to somewhat expensive ($1 or more per string). Nowadays it's possible to get strings that are fairly cheap <em>and</em> fairly good at the same time. Like the yoyos themselves, personal preference is a strong factor in how good the strings need to be, which characteristics are important to you, and how much you spend on them.</p>\n                <p>The cheapest strings:</p>\n                <ol className=\"list-decimal\">\n                  <li>Don't whip well&mdash;that is, they don't have enough body to form a good loop when doing a slack trick.</li>\n                  <li>Are especially prone to twisting up on themselves (all string does this as the tension changes naturally during play, but better strings resist it more).</li>\n                  <li>Don't last long, maybe a couple of hours. This is one of the more significant considerations costwise&mdash;the most expensive strings do often last a lot longer.</li>\n                  <li>Might be rough. Personally, I need my strings to be on the soft side since my hands are chapped all winter, but some popular bulk strings are rough and their fans don't seem to mind.

It's more bouncy and stretches more during play, and whips very fast. Blends vary in this depending on how much nylon is used. It's something of an acquired taste, but has a devoted following. It also tends to be fairly expensive, but that can be offset by the longevity.</p>\n                <p className=\"point\">Premium nylon is very soft on the hands, but also so slick that many players have to apply rosin to the finger loop to keep it from sliding off.

(Yes, you can find excellent plastic yoyos that are better than mediocre aluminum yoyos. That's not the point.) Plastic can work very well, though. Its main advantages over a decent budget/b-grade/pre-owned aluminum yoyo are situational:</p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>You're a beginner, or, are otherwise learning something that might cause you to hit yourself or other things a lot (ex: horizontal tricks, 5A tricks).</li>\n                <li>You're playing over pavement/bricks etc. Everyone should have some yoyos they don't mind damaging (if not all of them), but pavement dings on aluminum are the worst.</li>\n                <li>You're playing somewhere cold.
